Lore:

Long ago, it was said that a powerful man lived on earth, fighting against corruption and carmine.
But one day, he disappeared, leaving behind strange stones and letters, knowledge long lost. 
The last thing he said was that he was going to practice ascension...

Hello!

I'm a beginning developer, and The Plateaus is my first mod !
And it is still always in development!

At this moment, the mod adds:

- New Ore: Dark Ore. This is a beginning hardmode ore.
- New Armor: Dark Armor, for the melee class.
- New weapon: Dark Scythe Despair (crafted with Dark ingot)
- And... New Mechanic?: Enchantment Table! Try to use a RuneStone to create a new combination for your stuff (More damage, health, defense...)
and you can awaken weapons and armor for more stats, more powerful...

I think it is so powerful... I'll try to patch this soon.

But to finish this mod, I plan to:

- Create more NPC (Quest ? Marchant ?)
- System to date NPC
- New enemy
- New boss
- And ... the objective of this mod, a new dimension: The Plateaus ! (Five different plateaus)

Its a long journey... probably months or years to finish this.

If you are an artist for sprites, or a developer to help, you're welcome!
